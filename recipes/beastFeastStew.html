        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Beast Feast Stew was invented while living on a ranch in Wyoming and spending my time hunting with my friends. The idea was that we where all going to come together around the fire and make a stew which each person had to bring a meat that they had harvested. The first Beast Feast Stew consisted of Dear, Raccoon, Rabbit and Phesant along with vegetables.</p>
